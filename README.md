# Text based simulated Blackjack with one player and a dealer

# How to run this project

This is my second practice Python project. 

1.) You must have python installed on your computer 

2.) Run python BlackJack.py

3.) You will be prompted to place a bet, player starts with 100 chips. The dealer will deal out two cards to the player and
the dealer. One of the dealers cards will be hidden. The player will have the option to either hit or stand. The player can keep on hitting until they bust. Once the game is finished the player will be asked if they want to play again

4.) Play as many times as you like and have fun !
